      </ul>

      <h3><a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper" target="_blank">Grace Hopper</a> (1906 - 1992)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed the first compiler for a computer programming language, essential for modern software development.
</li>
        <li>Contributed to the development of COBOL, one of the earliest high-level programming languages used in business and government.
</li>
        <li>Coined the term "debugging" after finding a literal bug (a moth) in a computer.
</li>
        <li>Played a vital role in advancing early computer systems in the US Navy and served as a rear admiral.

<blockquote>
<p>"We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done. We should not be afraid to make mistakes; we should not be afraid to explore new areas. It is essential for us to remember that the next generation of computers will not be able to do anything but what they are programmed to do. However, if we can develop a machine that can learn and improve, we will be taking a step into a new world of possibilities."</p>
